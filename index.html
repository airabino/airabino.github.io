							<p style = "color: #eeeeee;">The transportation sector is fundamental to the modern economy and a major contributor to global emissions. Maintaining and expanding our wealth and living standards in the future requires sceintific and technological progress as well as the political mechanisms and will to implement structural changes. Because the transition to a green future must be accomplished in limited time and with limited capital, informed planning and coordination of efforts are required. My research aims to contribute to this effort in ways bith holistic and specific. Our economy relies on a stack of interconnected networks who's structures impact and are impacted by new technologies and new requirements. I study both the new technologies and their impoacts on underlying systems in order to understand where investmetns can have the greatest effects. Humans are part of the system and our social and governmental structures must be considered as the most important factor as to whether or not any positive change is possible.</p>

									<p style = "font-size: 10pt;">
										As governments and the automotive industry push toward electrification, it becomes increasingly critical to address the broad set of factors influence individual car buying decisions. Evidence suggests that operational inconvenience or the perception thereof plays a large role in consumer decisions concerning Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs). BEV ownership inconvenience and its causal factors have been relatively understudied, rendering efforts to mitigate the issues insufficiently informed. This paper presents an empirical equation, derived using a novel data-based method, which relates operational inconvenience to a small number of housing and local Electric Vehicle Supply Equimpent (EVSE) infrastructure factors. The equation and method provided can be used to conduct quantitative analyses on the inconvenience impacts of current and proposed EVSE infrastructure. Ultimately such a quantitative approach is needed to understand and mitigate large inequities of BEV experience and adoption which might emerge from electrification.

									<p style = "font-size: 10pt;">
										Connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) technology has the potential to enable significant gains in energy economy (EE). Much research attention has been focused on autonomous eco-driving control enabled by various methods. In this study, the state of the literature on autonomous eco-driving control is reviewed, an overall systems’ description of eco-driving control for a CAV is provided, and representative methods are evaluated comparatively against each other in simulation. Simulations are conducted using real-world traffic signal data and a validated future automotive systems technology simulator (FASTSim) model. Results indicate that an EE improvement in the range of 5%–15% is attainable depending on the method and cost function used. In this article it is shown that dynamic programming (DP) methods are most effective in improving EE but are significantly more computationally expensive than other methods. The genetic algorithm (GA) methods are shown to present the most potential in terms of EE improvement and run-time. Results also indicate that velocity-sensitive cost functions allow all the methods to perform better than pure acceleration minimization.
