Maintaining and expanding our wealth and living standards in the future requires sceintific and technological progress as well as the political mechanisms and will to implement structural changes. Because the transition to a green future must be accomplished in limited time and with limited capital, informed planning and coordination of efforts are required. My research aims to contribute to this effort in ways both holistic and specific. Our economy relies on a set of interconnected networks who's structures impact and are impacted by new technologies and new requirements. I study both the new technologies and their impoacts on underlying systems in order to understand where investmetns can have the greatest effects. Humans are part of the system and our social and governmental structures must be considered as the most important factor as to whether or not any positive change is possible.</p>

									<p style = "font-size: 10pt;text-align: justify;">
										As governments and the automotive industry push toward electrification, it becomes increasingly critical to address the broad set of factors influence individual car buying decisions. Evidence suggests that operational inconvenience or the perception thereof plays a large role in consumer decisions concerning Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs). BEV ownership inconvenience and its causal factors have been relatively understudied, rendering efforts to mitigate the issues insufficiently informed. This paper presents an empirical equation, derived using a novel data-based method, which relates operational inconvenience to a small number of housing and local Electric Vehicle Supply Equimpent (EVSE) infrastructure factors. The equation and method provided can be used to conduct quantitative analyses on the inconvenience impacts of current and proposed EVSE infrastructure. Ultimately such a quantitative approach is needed to understand and mitigate large inequities of BEV experience and adoption which might emerge from electrification.

									<p style = "font-size: 10pt;text-align: justify;">
										Connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) technology has the potential to enable significant gains in energy economy (EE). Much research attention has been focused on autonomous eco-driving control enabled by various methods. In this study, the state of the literature on autonomous eco-driving control is reviewed, an overall systemsâ€™ description of eco-driving control for a CAV is provided, and representative methods are evaluated comparatively against each other in simulation. Simulations are conducted using real-world traffic signal data and a validated future automotive systems technology simulator (FASTSim) model. Results indicate that an EE improvement in the range of 5%â€“15% is attainable depending on the method and cost function used. In this article it is shown that dynamic programming (DP) methods are most effective in improving EE but are significantly more computationally expensive than other methods. The genetic algorithm (GA) methods are shown to present the most potential in terms of EE improvement and run-time. Results also indicate that velocity-sensitive cost functions allow all the methods to perform better than pure acceleration minimization.

									<p style = "font-size: 10pt;text-align: justify;">
										Transportation vehicle and network system efficiency can be defined in two ways: 1) reduction of travel times across all the vehicles in the system, and 2) reduction in total energy consumed by all the vehicles in the system. The mechanisms to realize these efficiencies are treated as independent (i.e., vehicle and network domains) and, when combined, they have not been adequately studied to date. This research aims to integrate previously developed and published research on Predictive Optimal Energy Management Strategies (POEMS) and Intelligent Traffic Systems (ITS), to address the need for quantifying improvement in system efficiency resulting from simultaneous vehicle and network optimization. POEMS and ITS are partially independent methods which do not require each other to function but whose individual effectiveness may be affected by the presence of the other. In order to evaluate the system level efficiency improvements, the Mobility Energy Productivity (MEP) metric is used. MEP specifically measures the connectedness of a system while accounting for time and energy externalities of modes that provide mobility in a given location. A SUMO model is developed to reflect real traffic patterns in Fort Collins, Colorado and data is collected by a probe SUMO vehicle which is validated against data collected on a real vehicle driving the same routes through the city. Individual vehicle and system level efficiencies are calculated using SUMO outputs for scenarios which integrate POEMS and ITS independently as well as jointly. Results from application of POEMS and ITS show improvement in energy consumption and travel times respectively when compared to the respective baseline scenarios. Our conclusion is that there are promising synergistic benefits to travel time and energy efficiency when POEMS and ITS are combined.

									<p style = "font-size: 10pt;text-align: justify;">
										Even when charging at the highest rates currently available, Electric Vehicles (EVs) add range at substantially lower rates than Internal Combustion Engine Vehicles (ICVs) do while fueling. In addition, DC charging comes at a cost premium and leads to accelerated battery degradation. EV users able to rely on AC charging during long dwells at home or work may experience cost and time savings relative to ICV users with similar driving patterns. However, EV users unable to charge during long dwells will face higher charging costs and higher dedicated charging time. An important question is how occupants of Multi-Unit Dwellings (MUDs), which provide some AC Electric Vehicle Supply Infrastructure (EVSE) but not enough for all cars to charge at once, will be effected. In this paper the authorsâ€™ previously published method for quantifying EV user inconvenience due to charging is extended to deal with stochastic charger availability. Stochastic Mixed Integer Linear Programming (S-MILP) is used to determine optimal charging behavior for EV users based on itineraries and the likelihood of availability of charging. Expected inconveniences for levels of charger availability and the quantitative value of additional EVSE and of charger scheduling schemes are presented.
